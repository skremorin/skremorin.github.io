				Cyberbullying is an issue that befalls on us all. Cyberbullying is widespread within all social media platforms and is one of the most prominent types of bullying. This includes insults, social isolation and even psychological manipulation. The people on the internet are getting more and more toxic as more and more people go to it. In this essay we will reveal the flaws of such toxic cultures. The suggested action of the victim and friends of the victim as well as the reason for toxic cultures will also be discussed.
				</br>
				</p>
				<p>
				When someone gets cyberbullied, it means that they are being bullied by one or more people over the digital realm. Is there any way to fight back? Just turn off the computer and live your life. They should just man up and stand up for themselves. If they’re so weak that they are affected by just insult so much that they would kill themselves, then just let them kill themselves. Since all they could do is talk harsh online why not show them some physical pain instead? Talking things out and getting love and support from friends and family is the weak man’s strategy. This is not the time to be weak; when someone ridicules you, violence is the answer.
				</br>
				</p>
				<p>
				What’s better than violence? Being violent while targeting the weak because they can’t fight back just to feed your ego. If you want to popular or want to have superficial power, then the internet is just the right place for you. It’s time to act high and mighty because you are someone with a whopping 50 twitter followers; your entitlement is well deserved because you’re practically a celebrity. Feel the rush of adrenaline and your ego growing bigger as the number of people that know you on the internet rises,   knowing that almost none of them actually care about you. Instead of wasting time and energy making meaningful and wholesome relationships with people in real life, it is just more efficient to use the internet and get a lot people to pay attention to you. They say that 1 close friend is worth 10 acquaintances but you know that is complete and utter nonsense. You know that 10 is more than 1 because you are a genius and everybody who dares question it shall be cyberbullied to oblivion. 
				</br>
				</p>
				<p>
				Oblivion is what you will be if you fight back. You realize that you have no chance, right? You know what they say when you can beat them, join them. Your fear and lack of self-confidence is not the real problem here; it’s just that cyberbullying is just too strong. Instead of using your head to gather evidence about your perpetrator to stop them in their tracks, give in to the negative feeling that you have and join them to not only not get hurt anymore but to hurt others too. In the end, you have to fight back if they don’t stop. 
				</br>
				</p>
				<p>
				In all seriousness, when you get cyberbullied you have to surround yourself with family, friends, and other supportive people to help you get through it. You could gather evidence of their wrong doing and expose them so that they will now stop harassing you. Build meaningful relationships in order to suppress toxic behavior. In conclusion, toxicity comes from unhealthy sources and we should help each other right when we need it the most.
